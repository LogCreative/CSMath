\begin{problems}
    \item[1] All horses are the same color; we can prove this by induction on the number of horses in a given set. Here's how: If there's just one horse then it's the same color as itself, so the basis is trivial. 
    For the induction step, assume that there are $n$ horses numbered 1 to $n$. By the induction hypothesis, horses 1 through $n - 1$ are the same color, and similarly horses 2 through $n$ are the same color. 
    But the middle horses, 2 through $n - 1$, can't change color when they're in different groups; these are horses, not chameleons. 
    So horses 1 and $n$ must be the same color as well, by transitivity. Thus all $n$ horses are the same color; QED." What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning?
    \begin{solution}
        \textbf{It is wrong.} In fact, the definition of \emph{same} is not exact for $n=1$ senario. The \emph{same} should describe the relationship between two \emph{different} objects. The mathematical induction should start from $n=2$.

        For $n=2$, \emph{the middle horses} are not existed (from 2 through $n-1=1$). The basis step does not holds.
    \end{solution}

    \item[2] Find  the  shortest  sequence  of  moves  that  transfers  a  tower  of $n$ disks from the left peg $A$ to the right peg $B$, if direct moves between $A$ and $B$ are disallowed. (Each move must be to or from the middle peg. As usual, a larger disk must never appear above a smaller one.)
    
    \item[3] Show that, in the process of transferring a tower under the restrictions of the preceding exercise, we will actually encounter every properly stacked arrangement of $n$ disks on three pegs.
    
    \item[4] Are there any starting and ending congurations of $n$ disks on three pegs that are more than $2n-1$ moves apart, under Lucas's original rules?
    
    \item[5] A ``Venn diagram'' with three overlapping circles is often used to illustrate the eight possible subsets associated with three given sets:
    
    \input{diagram/venn.tex}

    Can the sixteen possibilities that arise with four given sets be illustrated by four overlapping circles?
